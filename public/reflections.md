## Q1 End of Lessons Relfections
#### Be07 Castillo, Sophia Violet C.

### **List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.**
1. Arithmetic Operiations 
    * These operations are the type that can perform arithmetic according to given symbols such as modulo (%) and division (/). While being quite easy to use, there are operations that are unable to be performed by the code such as exponentaion (^).
    * This topic is something that was discussed during grade 7 and 8 so during the lessons in person, the discussion felt more like a review than a new lesson. 
    * Not only that but arithmetic is pretty simple, with us just using pre made functions and simple symbols while leaving the rest for the computer itself to perform. And of course, since arithmetic is something that we use daily, all we needed to know was which symbol goes to which.
2. JS Input/ Output 
    * This topic is about how to input and output things into variables for them to be used, or displayed, depending on the programmed code. It allows your code to be seen and for variables to contain values inputted by the user.
    * Compared to Arithmetic Operations, this one was a new, but simple topic. We were introduced to JS and were taught how to input and output things based on given code. 
    * While being pretty confusing at times, when trying to figure out differences between each input and output code, the syntaxes for each of them were quite self explanatory and showed which was which, making it easy to understand quickly.
3. If Else Statements 
    * If else statements are used to determine specific parameters that need to be applied in order to run a set of code. The first line would be *if* and if needing more parameters before reaching else, if else, or else if, can be used.
    * Similar to Arithmetic, this topic was something we had done in previous years so, once again, it felt like more of a review than an actual lesson.
    * These statements also functioned the same as their C++ counterparts so other than a few changes such as formatting and required symbols, or lack thereof, this topic was really easy.
4. Loops
    * Loops are code that run a set of code a set amount of times according to specified parameters by the user.
    * Once again, this was a topic we had in previous years so it was easier to get and did not need as much practice to perfect.
    * While it also had tweaks, such as it not needing curly brackets to work all the time, or for loops working without some of the given parameters, the overall functions and formats are still the same as were in C++.
5. Declaring Functions 
    * Functions are lines of code that contain code, pre made or user declared, that can be called on when the user requires. 
    * Again, this topic was something we had in C++ that I was quite good at, so this topic came back to me quickly compared to newer lessons.
    * While it did not have much changes, there were parts I was originally confused about such as the usage of *break* and *continue*, I was able to get them during our lesson of the topic.

### **List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.""
1. HTML Tags
    * HTML tags are those that allow specific types of code, specifically text was what we used, into your code.
    * While this topic is a new one, it was quite simple to do. But compared to JS, was not as much discussion and limitations to what we learned.
2. Variable Declaration 
    * This topic allows variables to contain specific declarations, such as being an integer (int) or a string (string).
    * While this topic was one we used in C++, its javascript counterparts were more confusing to me because of their differences compared to C++. The change in delcaration types, specifically with var and let, were quite confusing and I think I could use more practice with that part specifically.
3. Comparison and Logical Operations
    * These are the operations that perform comparison and true or false type logic. 
    * While, once again, discussed in C++, the addition of === was most confusing to me, as I would view the JS code as I would have in C++. Not only that but for the longest time, I was quite confused with not (!) statmenets. But after more practice, I was able to understand the topic easily.
4. Switch Statements
    * Similar to if else, these statements allow specific code to be run based on given parameters.
    * Again, this was discusssed in C++, but was also something that I did not use as often compared to if else. Because of that, I had to relearn the lesson, and even now, still struggle with using it sometimes. 
5. Debugging Functions
    * This topic specifically involves being able to understand the code that requires debugging.
    * While functions itself is easy for me to do, debugging it is quite dificutlt for me. The Graded Exerise 7 was what specifically got me to put this topic under this section. Debugging is something that requires full undertsanding over the code and that is something I can practice further.

### **Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.**
1. Because most of those given topics are concept based, I need to further understand the topic in order to perfect it. This can be done through analizing what is needed and reviewing how the code is run and its impacts on the overall code.
2. Another thing I can do would be to practice coding tasks. The best way to learn something, for me, is to practice performing the tasks hand on. Because of hands on practice, I would be able to see specifically how the given code is outputted and build my understanding based on that.

### **In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?**
1. Effective
    * Graded Exercise 2 & 3
        - These were discussed in class and were so much fun and simple to do. Because it was done in person, they were well discussed and similar to our non graded exercise so the proccesses were easy to perform.
    * Graded Exercise 4
        - From what I remember, this task was given to us in class and was based on control structures. Since control structures are already prety self explanatory, this exercise helped further my understanding over them in a fun and effecetive way.

2. Ineffective
    * Kahoot Practices 
        - While fun, these reviews do not help me much in understanding topics, as they are meant to be used given you understand the topic. It is effective for reviewing but not so much in terms of understanding.
    * Graded Exercise 1
        - This exercise was the first we were given, and was tasked before we even discussed a topic. Because of that, we answered the exercise without much knowledge other than what we searched up online.
